# fend-classic-arcade-game-clone-project-3

Project 3 for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. The project recreates the classic game Frogger.

### Here are the requirements:

- Error Free - The game functions correctly and runs error free
    - Player can not move off screen
    - Vehicles cross the screen
    - Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
    - Vehicle-player collision resets the game
    - Something happens when player wins
- Object Oriented Code
    - Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
- Documentation
    - README - A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
    - Comments - Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.
    - Code Quality - Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html).
